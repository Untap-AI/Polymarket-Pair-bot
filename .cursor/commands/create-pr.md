# create-pr

Create a PR for our changes against the main branch.

For the description and title, try to explain what we accomplished with the changes from a holistic perspective, rather than listing out each separate file/detail we implemented.

Use the Cursor MCP server to create the PR. Check the diff if you need context into the changes.
